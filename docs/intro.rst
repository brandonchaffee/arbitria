Amenability
~~~~~~~~~~~
The underlying rationale behind Ethereum smart contracts is to provide a decentralized set rules and protocols
which must be followed and cannot be broken. The idea of adding amenability to this seems at oppositions with
core of this rationale. While this is true for total amenability, amenability with a predefined and immutable
underlying structure can remain inline with the core smart contract rationale while also providing
substaintial benefits to the smart contract ecosystem as a whole. The purpose of Arbitria is to provide a
structure for amenability which does not infringe on the immutable nature of smart contract while
simultaneously providing proper methodology for modifying and upgrading smart contract in a democratic and
decentralized manner.

This system is enacted through a set of protocols in which the underyling smart contract can only be modified
or upgraded should a certain predefined set of conditions be met and agreed upon by the underyling
stakeholders of the contract.



Statutory Voting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to establish a fair and equitable methodology for voting on prospective
proposals and modifications, the use of statutory voting rights are establish
within Arbitria. Statutory voting involves a voting rights structure in which an
entity's particular number of voting rights is equal to that entity's
respective stake of the underlying organization.

This has a distinct advantage over regular, one vote per entity, voting
structures as the identification and attribution of a voting right generally
must be administered in a centralized fashion within the Ethereum ecosystem.


Status
~~~~~~
Arbitria has currently been fully tested for all necessary functionality with
regards to ERC20 tokens. Further development is necessary for more complex
token structures (ERC827, ERC721, etc.).
