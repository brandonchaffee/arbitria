Statutory Voting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to establish a fair and equitable methodology for voting on prospective
proposals and modifications, the use of statutory voting rights are establish
within Arbitria. Statutory voting involves a voting rights structure in which an
entity's particular number of voting rights is equal to that entity's
respective stake of the underlying organization.

This has a distinct advantage over regular, one vote per entity, voting
structures as the identification and attribution of a voting right generally
must be administered in a centralized fashion within the Ethereum ecosystem.


Status
~~~~~~
Arbitria has currently been fully tested for all necessary functionality with
regards to ERC20 tokens. Further development is necessary for more complicated
token structures (ERC827, ERC721, etc.).
